## AI for all

![Memori](https://memori.ai/en/assets/memoriai-fulltext.svg/@@images/image/mini)

Memori is an Italian startup specialising in technologies applied to the experience of memory through the development of Artificial Intelligences.

Our mission is to bring the human dimension at the core of Artificial Intelligence creation, with the aim of improving people's lives.

### NO CODE

The simplest form of user experience management is conversation.

That's why Memori adopts an end-to-end conversational model.

Memori creates Conversational Artificial Intelligences that grow with their creator through a conversation. We call this an extreme no-code approach: the creator doesn't need to know software development code or use graphical interfaces. Just pure and simple conversation.

### OMNICANITY

Artificial Intelligence created by a user must be usable through a variety of channels.

We firmly believe in the value of omnichanneling.

We are the first to make it possible to export AI to the Google Action standard with a single click. The omnichannel strategy implemented in our framework enables the seamless delivery of conversational experiences across web, mobile, IoT systems, smart speakers and augmented/virtual reality.

## TwinCreator

[TwinCreator](https://twincreator.com/en) is our Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI) business virtualisation framework, which aims to be introduced to the market as SaaS.

## MemoryTwin

[MemoryTwin](https://memorytwin.com/en) is our tool which, by conversing with the user, makes it possible for anyone to build and distribute a virtual digital twin of themselves.
